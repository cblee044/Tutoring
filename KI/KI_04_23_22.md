## Polar and Rectangular Coordinates

Polar-Rectangular Conversions
```math
x=rcos(\theta)\\
y=rsin(\theta)
```

More relationships
```math
r^2=x^2+y^2\\
tan(\theta)=\frac{y}{x}
```

#### Example 1
Convert this equation into polar form
```math
x^2+y^2=9
```
First substitute the polar-rectangular conversions into the equation. This gives us
```math
(rcos(\theta))^2+(rsin(\theta))^2=9
```
In a sense, you have successfully converted the equation into polar coordinates, but we can simplify further and find something interesting. Try factoring our the r.
```math
r^2\big[cos^2(\theta)+sin^2(\theta)\big]=9
```
Recall the trig. identity $sin^2{\theta}+cos^2{\theta}=1$. So, we get
```math
r^2=9\\
r=3
```
#### Example 2
Convert this equation into polar coordinates
```math
3y=x
```
Make the substitutes like we did in example 1.
```math
3(rsin(\theta))=rcos(\theta)
```
Note: the $r$'s cancel out when I divide both sides by $r$.
```math
tan(\theta)=\frac{1}{3}\\
\theta=tan^{-1}(\frac{1}{3})
```
This is the polar representation of the original equation. Interpret it like this. For any value of $r$, $\theta =tan^{-1}(\frac{1}{3})$

❗️Warning: The difference between our results and the work you've done for point conversion is that point conversions give you one $\theta$ and $r$ value. For equations, you will either obtain a relationship between $\theta$ and $r$ or have an equation with only $\theta$ or only $r$. 

Think about the point $(3,4)$ and the equation $x=3$
